The Nordic Equation is building a trusted community where leaders collaborate to develop impactful solutions to societal challenges through peer learning and collective action. Together, we are redefining leadership for a complex, interconnected world.  

To support this vision, we are creating a “womb of creation” — an ecosystem nurtured by a diverse network of bespoke partners. This ecosystem supports CEOs and other courageous leaders who aim to lead beyond their organizations. It harnesses the unique expertise of institutions like the Stockholm Resilience Centre and Drift for Transition, alongside transformative wayfinders such as Nature Academy, Planethon, and others.  

To realize our vision fully, we believe modern science, transformative practices, and data & AI integration are essential for exponential capacity building. In May 2025, we will host our first Immersive Experience in Stockholm with 20 C-suite leaders. I’m excited to explore how River and the Nordic Equation can collaborate to create an ethical meta-framework that enhances co-evolutionary learning labs and accelerates collective action.  

As we expand our network of wayfinders to support the post-immersive journey, I’m pleased that Louise and Frederik from Albaeco, Vivianne as well as Mickael Drouard, may join us.  

I’m glad we can meet to explore River’s vision and potential on the morning of December 18th in Stockholm.
