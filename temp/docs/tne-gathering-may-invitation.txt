> \- Paul Polman, Former CEO Unilever & Sustainability advocate

#### Unite those movers that raise our collective ambition

> "Today's CEOs have a unique opportunity to transition from passive observers to active architects of a better future. The Nordic Equation empowers leaders with insights, tools, and a collaborative network to elevate ambition and drive transformative action.

### Making collaboration attractive

We believe that businesses have a crucial role to play in leading the way toward a future where both people and the planet can thrive. But to do this, organizations and leaders must first reinvent themselves.

We offer an ecosystem based on principles of trust, innovation and collaboration, to foster collective learning and unite those brave European first movers that lead beyond the incremental. The program will make unseen interdependencies visible, and help you make new connections with likeminded leaders to initiate systemic shifts.

### Navigating Complexity

A new business context is emerging, characterized by increasing polarization, geo-political tension and extreme events caused by climate change. Together these changes create a business environment that is more unpredictable and volatile. In response, expectations from investors, employees, and customers are shifting rapidly. Simultaneously, technological, policy, and scientific advancements offer new opportunities for adaptation and transformation. Navigating this complexity requires a new way of thinking and acting.

### 3-Day Immersive Experience

15-17 May 2025, 15 influential leaders from Europe will join the Nordic Equation for a transformative 3-day experience aimed at shaping a positive future. This immersive program combines the latest science with practical tools, including Planetary Boundaries, Resilience Thinking, and Future Literacy. Leaders will recalibrate their compass, expand their imagination, and gain insights to navigate complexity with clarity. Through engagement with thought leaders and cutting-edge science, participants will build a foundation for impactful leadership and meaningful, systemic change.

After the event, participants will be invited to a network of curated partners, capabilities, and thought leaders to support their ongoing journey.
