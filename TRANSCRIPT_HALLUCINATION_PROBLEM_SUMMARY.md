# Transcript Hallucination Problem: Complete Analysis

## The Core Issue

Our real-time transcription system suffers from a catastrophic hallucination problem that manifests after approximately 20 minutes of operation, with hallucination rates reaching 60-70%.

### Specific Symptom Pattern
```
First transcription: "Sen kommer jag att testa lite saker på den här" ✓ (correct)
ALL subsequent transcriptions: "Sen kommer jag..." ✗ (contaminated)
```

The phrase **"Sen kommer jag"** (Swedish: "Then I will come") from the very first valid transcription contaminates every subsequent transcription, regardless of what the user actually says.

### Evidence from Latest Test Session
- **Session Duration**: ~7 minutes 
- **Starting Hallucination Rate**: 50%
- **Ending Hallucination Rate**: 70% (getting worse over time)
- **Pattern**: Even when user said "I morgon på jobbet ska jag gå upp tidigt" (Tomorrow at work I'll get up early), Whisper produced "Sen kommer jag..."

## What We Tried and Failed

### Attempt 1: VAD Optimization (Phase 1) ❌ FAILED
**Theory**: Poor voice activity detection was allowing silent segments to reach Whisper, causing hallucinations.

**Changes Made**:
- VAD Aggressiveness: 2 → 3 (stricter voice detection)
- Segment Duration: 15s → 8s (shorter segments to limit hallucination window)
- Added `is_audio_silent()` function with RMS threshold
- Silent segment filtering before Whisper processing

**Result**: Contamination persisted. The "Sen kommer jag" pattern continued appearing.

### Attempt 2: Whisper Parameter Optimization (Phase 2) ❌ FAILED  
**Theory**: Default Whisper parameters weren't optimized for real-time transcription.

**Changes Made**:
```python
# Previous
temperature: 0.0
no_speech_threshold: 0.9
condition_on_previous_text: True (default)

# New "Optimized"
temperature: 0.1                    # Slight randomness to prevent loops
no_speech_threshold: 0.8            # More sensitive to silence
logprob_threshold: -0.7             # Balanced threshold
condition_on_previous_text: False   # Prevent context contamination
```

**Result**: Actually made it WORSE. Hallucination rate increased and contamination became more persistent.

### Attempt 3: Context Management Reform (Phase 3) ❌ FAILED
**Theory**: Poor context management was causing feedback loops. Better prompts would guide Whisper correctly.

**Changes Made**:
- **Stable Base Prompts**: Language-specific prompts that "never cause bleeding"
  ```python
  'sv': "Detta är en professionell konversation på svenska."
  'en': "This is a professional conversation in English."
  ```
- **Context Decay**: Instead of clearing context completely, decay to stable base
- **Prompt Combination**: Always combine stable base with recent context
- **Context Cleaning**: Remove system instructions that could bleed through

**Result**: Complete failure. The contamination persisted and actually got worse because we kept feeding the poisoned context back to Whisper.

## Why All Attempts Failed: The Fundamental Misunderstanding

We were treating **context as the cure when context was actually the poison**.

### The Real Problem: Whisper Context Poisoning
1. **Whisper treats prompts as "expected continuation"**
2. **Once "Sen kommer jag" entered the context, it became self-reinforcing**
3. **Every attempt to "manage" context better made contamination worse**
4. **The more sophisticated our context management, the more persistent the contamination**

### Our Failed Logic Chain
```
Problem: Hallucinations
→ Solution: Better context management
→ Result: More hallucinations
→ Response: Even better context management  
→ Result: Even more hallucinations
→ Cycle continues...
```

## The Breakthrough Realization

After days of failed attempts, the logs revealed the truth:

**The phrase "Sen kommer jag" was being fed back to Whisper as context/prompt, causing Whisper to expect this phrase to continue in every new segment.**

This is a textbook case of **Whisper context poisoning** - a well-known issue in production real-time transcription systems.

## Industry Reality Check

Many production systems avoid this exact problem by using **zero context**:
- **Google Speech-to-Text**: No context between utterances  
- **Azure Speech Services**: Segment isolation by default
- **AWS Transcribe**: No cross-segment context sharing

## Lessons Learned

1. **Context can be poison in real-time transcription**
2. **More sophisticated != better** (our "advanced" context management made it worse)
3. **Industry best practices exist for a reason** (zero-context is standard)
4. **Fighting symptoms instead of root cause** (we optimized everything except the core issue)
5. **Sometimes the best solution is elimination, not optimization**

## The Zero-Context Solution

Our final approach: **Complete elimination of all context and prompts**
- No `prompt` parameter in Whisper API calls
- No context sharing between segments  
- Each segment processed in complete isolation
- Post-processing contamination detection instead of pre-processing prevention

**Result Expected**: Hallucination rate drops from 60-70% to <10% by eliminating the contamination source entirely.

## Key Insight

**The best context is no context.** 

We spent days trying to optimize context management when we should have been eliminating context entirely.
