### Procurement of Consultancy Services Trends

The buying of consultancy services has evolved significantly, driven by changes in technology, business needs, and market dynamics. Here are the top 5-6 key trends shaping the procurement of consultancy services. These trends reflect the evolving nature of client demands, as businesses expect more value, accountability, and tailored expertise from consulting services.

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. Outcome-Based Contracts | * Focus on Results Over Time: Clients are increasingly demanding outcome-based contracts where consultants are paid based on the value they deliver, rather than just the hours worked. This model aligns consultant incentives with client goals, pushing for measurable business outcomes (e.g., revenue growth, cost reduction) \n * Performance Metrics: Companies are specifying clear KPIs and deliverables to measure the success of consultancy engagements |
| 2. Specialization & Niche Expertise | * Demand for Domain Experts: Businesses are seeking specialized consultants with deep expertise in particular industries, functions, or emerging technologies (e.g., AI, digital transformation, sustainability). Generalist consulting firms are still relevant but are increasingly pressured to show expertise in niche areas \n * Boutique Consulting Firms: Boutique firms with a laser focus on specific sectors or issues are growing in demand as they offer high expertise at often lower rates than the large consultancies |
| 3. Use of Technology & Digital Platforms | * Tech-Enabled Consulting: Consultants are incorporating AI, data analytics, and digital tools to provide deeper insights and more actionable recommendations. Clients are looking for partners that can leverage technology to optimize solutions and improve decision-making processes \n * Virtual Consulting Services: With remote work becoming normalized, many consultancy services are delivered virtually, lowering costs and expanding access to global experts. This trend has also increased the demand for flexible, on-demand consulting arrangements |
| 4. Cost-Effectiveness & Transparent Pricing Models | * Pressure on Pricing: With tighter budgets and a focus on ROI, clients are pushing for cost-effective solutions and clearer pricing models. This includes breaking down costs, reducing overheads, or offering modular services where businesses pay only for what they need \n * Freelance and Gig-Based Consulting: Platforms that offer freelance consultants and gig-based expertise are becoming a cost-effective alternative to traditional consulting firms, providing flexibility and competitive pricing |
| 5. Sustainability & ESG Consulting | * Focus on ESG: As sustainability becomes a key part of corporate strategies, businesses are increasingly seeking consultants who can advise on ESG practices, including carbon reduction, social responsibility, and governance frameworks \n * Compliance and Risk Mitigation: Many companies are turning to consultants to navigate the growing complexity of regulatory frameworks related to ESG and sustainability, as well as to mitigate reputational and legal risks |
| 6. Long-Term Partnerships Over One-Off Projects | * Strategic Relationships: There is a shift towards forming long-term partnerships with consulting firms instead of one-off, short-term engagements. Clients see value in building relationships with consultants who understand their business deeply, helping in continuous strategy execution and transformation \n * Retainer Models: Some clients are adopting retainer-based relationships where consultants provide ongoing advisory support as opposed to time-bound projects |

### Real Estate Industry Trends (Focus Stockholm)

Source: https://www.ey.com/sv_se/real-estate-hospitality-construction/fem-trender-pa-fastighetsmarknaden-2024

| Theme | Description | Implications |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 1. Shorter terms and more flexible offices are in demand | Remote work and new ways of working is increasing. Lease agreements with shorter terms can be particularly noticeable in real estate companies with many fast-growing companies as tenants. Companies aiming for rapid expansion may find it difficult to justify five- or seven-year contracts. | * In a situation where the demand for office space is decreasing, modern and flexible premises tend to do best \n * Offices are a changing product and here is an opportunity for property companies to help tenants review and adapt their premises needs to the new reality |
| 2. Sustainability is increasing in importance | Construction and property companies have taken big steps towards more sustainable construction and more sustainable management. When renovating and rebuilding offices, for example, many construction and real estate companies invest in reusing products instead of tearing them out and buying new ones. | * Increased demands on sustainability also affect investors, fund operators and banks. Properties that do not keep up with the development will be seen as riskier investments \n * Buying interest, mainly from pension funds and other institutional investors, is also increasingly driven by green properties \n * Tenants may also be prepared to pay more to rent green premises |
| 3. Financing transition from bonds to bank loans | When the zero interest rate was introduced in 2014, money flowed into the real estate sector. The historically record low interest rate meant that property companies increasingly financed themselves via bonds due to the favorable terms instead of via traditional bank loans. When interest rates started to rise, it not only led to higher costs of bank loans, but also to the drying up of the bond market. | * Financing via bonds is now being phased out in favor of bank loans, which today are a cheaper and more accessible alternative \n * Many real estate companies have found themselves in a situation with rising financing costs and a need to refinance their bonds \n * However, the banks will probably be selective in their refinancing of bond debt and prioritize customers with whom they have a long-term relationship |
| 4. Indexation of rents | In most leases, it is the index number for the month of October that governs the rent adjustment for the following year. The consumer price index (CPI) for October 2023 ended up at 6.5 percent. In two years, 2023 and 2024, the rent increases in existing agreements for premises have been increased by almost 18 percent. \n\n It is a significant increase and several tenants in the retail sector have chosen to terminate their contracts. There is a risk that this will spread to other parts of the property market, and the higher the rents, the greater the risk. | * The total cost picture for tenants is not only affected by the indexation, but also by, for example, electricity costs, heating, garbage collection and increased assessment values \n * The question is whether the willingness to pay, i.e. the market rent, will increase at the same rate as the contracted rents or whether we end up in a situation where the market rent is lower than the outgoing rents? \n * In the choice between higher vacancies and lower rental income during renegotiation, property owners can be proactive and work with their contract stock |
| 5. Real Estate Production Crash | In recent years, the number of housing projects started and planned has fallen rapidly as a result of increased construction costs, rising mortgage interest rates, falling condominium prices and weaker household purchasing power | * The interest in building rental properties has been negatively affected by the scrapped investment support and the change in the enumeration of properties with presumptive rent \n * As it is difficult for the developers to get their calculations together, there is therefore a tangible risk that the deficit of housing will continue to grow - both with regard to condominiums and rental properties |

Facility managers now focus on optimizing spaces for flexible, activity-based environments that can efficiently accommodate both remote and in-office employees. Real-time data on space utilization is increasingly used to enhance productivity and reduce costs \n * The shift to hybrid working models is significantly impacting FM. Facility managers are tasked with creating adaptable, modular workspaces that accommodate both remote and in-office employees. This includes coworking spaces and technology-driven layouts that provide flexibility and improve the overall workplace experience |
| 4. Health, Safety and Wellness Initiatives | * Employee well-being is becoming a critical element of FM strategies, particularly in light of the pandemic. Ensuring health and safety through better workplace design, indoor air quality, and sanitation measures are seen as essential for maintaining a productive and engaged workforce \n * Ergonomic furniture, and wellness features such as fitness areas or relaxation zones are aimed at boosting employee productivity and retention |
| 5. Collaboration and Integration with HR | * There is a growing emphasis on the integration of FM with HR functions, particularly as the physical workspace plays a crucial role in talent retention, employee engagement, and overall workplace culture \n * FM professionals are increasingly involved in strategic discussions to align workplace services with broader organizational goals |
| 6. Specialization and Outsourcing | * There is a clear trend towards outsourcing specialized FM services \n * Organizations are moving away from comprehensive contracts toward collaborating with niche providers who can offer expertise in specific areas, creating an ecosystem of service providers rather than relying on single large contracts \n * These trends reflect the ongoing evolution of facility management, emphasizing sustainability, digital transformation, and workplace adaptation |

### Impactful shifts affecting the FM industry over the coming 10 years

|-------|-------------|
| 1. Digitalisation & Robotisation | * Both suppliers and customers emphasize that digitization and automation received a boost during and after the pandemic. A clear trend is increased digitization and the use of IoT technology to optimize resource use and improve the user experience \n * Digitization also means the need for new skills among employees and the development of processes and delivery models that make technology an integrated part of FM \n * Increased digitization and data use enables more efficient resource utilization, clearer control and thus sustainable customer delivery |
| 2. Sustainability & Circular Economy | * The goals in Agenda 2030 are guiding principles for many companies and organizations, in both the private and public sectors \n * Everyone needs to review how we live, eat, travel and work, and it will require sacrifices in the form of changed habits to achieve the goals \n * At the same time, increased collaboration across company and organizational boundaries will be required in order to jointly achieve more sustainable working methods \n * Circularity with a high proportion of reuse is a clear part of the trend |
| 3. Security & Resilience | * An increased focus on preparedness and that more and more people are reflecting on how suppliers contribute to crisis management \n * Safety issues have exploded - not least because of the new legislation. A lot more contracts take safety into account - function is procured instead of quality \n * Crises such as the pandemic mean that the FM industry is significantly more alert to rapid changes and the need for resilience, to be able to quickly replace key personnel and develop new skills |
| 4. New collaboration models and positions | * The role of FM managers will continue to develop towards being more strategic and integrated with the organization's overall goals and operations \n * Following the pandemic's demands, the HR department and top management became involved in the FM work for a rapid transition to hybrid work \n * FM functions as a lubricant for the core business – the pandemic and other crises show the enormous opportunities that FM offers. Without service operations, the organization is paralyzed, especially clearly in a crisis situation \n * Soft FM is moving towards the HR department, while technical FM is becoming significantly more digitized and automated |

### Deep Dive II: The Future of Work

### Framework to analyse the Future of Work

| Dimension | Force | Effect |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Nature of work | Technological advancements | Automation, artificial intelligence, robotics, and digitalization, are fundamentally transforming the nature of work. These technologies are changing job roles, skills requirements, work processes, and business models across industries |
| What work can be automated? | Shift to Knowledge-based Economy | The global economy is increasingly driven by knowledge, information, and innovation. Jobs requiring analytical, problem-solving, and creative thinking skills are in high demand, while routine, manual tasks are being automated. The future of work will prioritize skills related to critical thinking, digital literacy, adaptability, and creativity |
| Workforce | Globalisation & Remote Work | Globalization and technological connectivity have facilitated remote work, virtual teams, and distributed workforces. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote work and highlighted its potential for flexibility, productivity, and cost savings |
| Who can do the work? | Skills Gap & Lifelong Learning | There is a growing gap between the skills workers possess and the skills demanded by evolving job markets. Lifelong learning and continuous skill development are becoming essential for workforce readiness and employability. Employers, educational institutions, and governments are investing in upskilling, reskilling, and education programs to bridge the skills gap |
| | Demographic shifts | Changing demographics, such as an aging population, generational differences (e.g., millennials, Gen Z), and increasing workforce diversity, are influencing workforce composition, preferences, and behaviors. These shifts impact recruitment, talent management, and workplace culture |
| Workplace | Changing Work Arrangements | Traditional employment arrangements are evolving, with the rise of freelancing, gig work, and alternative work arrangements. The gig economy offers flexibility but also raises questions about job security, benefits, and labor rights. Employers are exploring new ways of organizing work and talent to adapt to changing workforce preferences |
| Where is the work done? | Emphasis on Well-being & Work-Life Balance | There is a growing emphasis on employee well-being, mental health, and work-life balance. Organizations are prioritizing initiatives such as flexible work schedules, wellness programs, and supportive workplace cultures to attract and retain talent |

### Different generations view on work

| Generation | Ideal work environment | Values | Work style |
|------------|----------------------|--------|------------|
| Traditionalists/The Silent Generation: Born 1928–1945 | Structured and stable work environments help traditionalists excel. They appreciate clear expectations and fixed work schedules | Traditionalists uphold work values like loyalty, respect, and discipline. They often grew up with more conservative social norms and prioritize hard work and attention to rules | might be used to transactional leadership: you perform your job in exchange for a paycheck without too much emotional investment. They appreciate hierarchies and procedures and prefer to separate personal from professional |
| Baby Boom Generation: Born 1946–1964 | They don't always need constant feedback or micromanaging from higher-ups. Boomers will likely assume the ship is on track unless authority lets them know otherwise | Baby boomers didn't switch jobs often throughout their careers. They value hard work and paying their dues, adopting the previous generation's desire for authoritative leadership styles and a sense of duty | Structure, clear goals, and specific deadlines will keep baby boomers advancing toward objectives. They're ambitious — and although they don't need a lot of back-and-forth from their teams, they appreciate the recognition of their work |

| Generation X: Born 1965–1980 | Gen X workers are usually more comfortable with telecommuting and flexible work schedules. They value work-life balance and prefer efficiency so they have more time for their personal lives | Diversity and personal development are more important to Gen X than loyalty to a company's interest. They're often skeptical of authority and believe competence is more important than rank. Likewise, they're faster to leave their job for a new one when their goals don't align with the company's | They're independent and adaptable. They engage with immediate and clear feedback and prefer efficiency over form — phone calls, face-to-face communication, or email all work |
| Millennial Generation/Generation Y: Born 1981–1996 | Many millennials excel when they see a clear path toward career growth. Professional development, promotion opportunities, and team building activities are all important to their employee experience | Most millennials want to be a part of something bigger than profits. They value sustainability, work-life balance, and a sense of belonging in their professional lives | Flexibility and work-life balance are often large parts of the millennial work style. Freedom to manage their schedules, pursue remote work opportunities, and find time for self-care is key to avoiding burnout. Most people in this generation prefer video calls, 1:1 meetings, and social activities that build stronger interpersonal relationships |
| Generation Z or iGen: Born 1997–2010 | For Gen Z, company culture should reflect diversity, equity, and inclusion. Many younger employees seek non-traditional work schedules and flexible, remote work opportunities | Gen Z often yearns for personal connection in the workplace. Empathy, open communication styles, and attention to mental health are among their top priorities. While they don't readily connect their profession to personal identity, they want to have open conversations with management and colleagues about their personal values | Most people in this generation prefer video calls, 1:1 meetings, and social activities that build stronger interpersonal relationships |

### Values and priorities are changing, whilst mental health issues are present

Gains in living standards allow us to spend less time working but raise expectations about what a job should provide.

Younger generations, especially in advanced economies, are under mounting stress that spills over into their work lives.

### "AI Won't Replace Humans — But Humans With AI Will Replace Humans Without AI" - Karim Lakhani 

* a professor at Harvard Business School who specializes in workplace technology and particularly AI
* He's done pioneering work in identifying how digital transformation has remade the world of business
* he's the co-author of the 2020 book Competing in the Age of AI
* "machine learning has basically changed the very rules of business"

### "...change and change management become skills for managers and for leaders and for executives. How you change, how you continuously change, how you build a DNA for changing becomes very important."

* "The best companies will be the ones that can understand how change becomes a skill. If you think about change as a skill, what does that mean?
* Skills require acquisition of the skills. You've got to invest in learning."
* "What does it mean to change?
* It requires practice. You've got to keep changing as well. And it requires adjustment.
* Those elements I think will become a key part of the ways in which leaders need to adapt to this world."

### Deep Dive III: AI's impact on the Future of Work

### WHY Generative AI will impact work

In a few simple words: Because Generative AI can create original content.

* It is a true disruptive workforce shift, indicative of a future in which work and technology meld in ways previously unthinkable
* Moreover, this is the first time a technological revolution of this magnitude has been so widely accessible to anyone with an internet connection
* Generative AI profoundly supports human expertise and skills—writing memos and reports, designing website graphics, creating personalized marketing strategies, and curating employee learning programs, for example
* The examples of AI-enabled content creation listed in the table illustrate the breadth of work that can be augmented using Generative AI
* It's important to keep in mind, however, that Generative AI isn't designed to replace humans, but it is about to change how they work
* Ideally, in its perfect state, Generative AI can bolster innovation, productivity, and outcomes while making work easier for people

### HOW will this effect Humans at work?

Generative AI's future success will hinge on a renewed focus on humans.

* The need for humans didn't diminish with the invention of the personal computer
* They got better and faster at accomplishing work. If done well, Generative AI can aspire to the same promise: Making humans better at work and work better for humans
* begin to consider "future-proofing" the Generative AI-enabled workforce because work is apt to shift quickly and workers will need new skills
* organizations are on the precipice of a significant shift in the nature of work, with implications cascading to the workforce and workplace

* For Content Creation: It's crucial to recognize that while Generative AI can generate content, the depth, nuance, and cultural awareness of human creation are irreplaceable
* Less-experienced workers: Research from MIT suggests that workers with the least education and career preparation may benefit most from Generative AI. This research observed a 14% productivity increase among contact center agents who used a conversational AI assistant, with the largest gains seen among new or low-skilled workers. These workers were effectively upskilled by the technology, rather than replaced
* re-architecting the work opens the door to improved individual and team performance and employee experience, satisfaction, and retention. Breaking down and redistributing activities can create new opportunities for employees and make them even more valuable to the organization

### Breakdown of dimensions to consider for AI's impact on the Future of Work

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Work/Output | * Work is defined as the outcome created (e.g., achieving sales targets, enhancing user experience, increasing customer satisfaction) by leveraging human capabilities and the tools they have invented to help accomplish the goal |
| Jobs | * Jobs are the traditional construct to describe the work humans do to achieve the outcomes \n * There's significant concern about jobs disappearing due to Generative AI's ability to automate tasks, but that's not the complete picture \n * First, tasks aren't jobs \n * Second, we need to look at skills to understand how jobs will be redefined given the adoption of Generative AI |
| Tasks | * Tasks are specific activities performed to achieve work outcomes \n * Historically, we have thought of tasks as part of the work people perform in jobs, and that's still the case \n * Tasks require skills and tools to achieve a certain outcome \n * Generative AI may automate those tasks altogether, freeing up a worker's ability to focus on new tasks, or they make those tasks easier for people and create time for the individuals \n * Some tasks humans do better. Some tasks machines do better. Some tasks are better done with a combination of the two |
| Skills | * Skills enable us to carry out the tasks necessary to achieve work outcomes \n * Both humans and Generative AI have skills that can perform tasks to create work outcomes \n * Understanding the skill sets within your organisation and the various job roles that use them can shape the future of work with Generative AI \n * Doing so will help determine what kind of upskilling curricula will be necessary for workers down the road—readying their workforce for automation, strategizing for augmentation, appreciating human-centric skills, and even pioneering new roles \n * We have long said it's "humans with machines" and not humans or machines that will transcend leading organisations |

### Leading in a Generative AI era

* In the world of Generative AI disruption, the role of leadership transcends traditional management
* Leaders must seize the reins, steering their organizations with clear vision and strategic wisdom
* It isn't necessary for executives to be Generative AI experts—what is important is to create and manage by a framework that focuses on and supports leadership's vital role in guiding Generative AI-induced changes

In this framework, leadership must consider the following:

| Leadership Area | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Visibly commit to Generative AI strategy | Visibly commitment to Generate AI's strategy is not just a signal of approval; it's a beacon of direction. Leaders must not only acknowledge the power of Generative AI, but also actively promote and integrate it into the organizational fabric. They must show that Generative AI is not a fleeting trend but a fundamental part of the future strategy |
| Champion the benefits of Generative AI | It's up to executives to take the lead in illustrating the transformative impact of Generative AI on the organization. This includes highlighting the success stories, real-world applications and the tangible benefits that Generative AI brings. Their advocacy will create enthusiasm and drive engagement at all levels |
| Openly address concerns & resistance | Resistance to change is natural, and Generative AI is no exception. Leaders need to address concerns head-on, engage in open dialogues and break down barriers of fear or misunderstanding. Their openness not only builds trust but aligns the entire organization with the Generative AI mission |
| Foster a safe environment for experimentation & learning | Leaders must lead by example in creating an environment where innovation and experimentation with Generative AI are encouraged. They must recognize that mistakes are not failures but valuable learning experiences. A culture that celebrates exploration and learning accelerates Generative AI adoption and mastery |
| Implement guidelines & governance for Generative AI usage | The responsible use of Generative AI requires clear guidelines and governance. Leaders must define when and how Generative AI should be used within the organization and establish protocols, ensuring that Generative AI is not being used ad hoc, but with organizational support. Leadership in this area protects both the integrity of the organization and the ethical use of Generative AI |
| Promote responsible use of generative AI | Ethical considerations must be at the forefront of Generative AI deployment. Executives must lead initiatives to educate and enforce responsible use of Generative AI, ensuring compliance with laws and alignment with the organization's values and societal norms |

### Deep Dive IV: Human-Machine Collaboration

### Humans Assisting Machines

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Training | * Machine-learning algorithms must be taught how to perform the work they're designed to do. In that effort, huge training data sets are amassed to teach machine-translation apps to handle idiomatic expressions, medical apps to detect disease, and recommendation engines to support financial decision making \n * In addition, AI systems must be trained how best to interact with humans. While organizations across sectors are now in the early stages of filling trainer roles, leading tech companies and research groups already have mature training staffs and expertise |
| Explaining | * As AIs increasingly reach conclusions through processes that are opaque (the so-called black-box problem), they require human experts in the field to explain their behavior to nonexpert users \n * These "explainers" are particularly important in evidence-based industries, such as law and medicine, where a practitioner needs to understand how an AI weighed inputs into, say, a sentencing or medical recommendation \n * Explainers are similarly important in helping insurers and law enforcement understand why an autonomous car took actions that led to an accident—or failed to avoid one \n * And explainers are becoming integral in regulated industries—indeed, in any consumer-facing industry where a machine's output could be challenged as unfair, illegal, or just plain wrong |
| Sustaining | * In addition to having people who can explain AI outcomes, companies need "sustainers"—employees who continually work to ensure that AI systems are functioning properly, safely, and responsibly \n * For example, an array of experts sometimes referred to as safety engineers focus on anticipating and trying to prevent harm by AIs. The developers of industrial robots that work alongside people have paid careful attention to ensuring that they recognize humans nearby and don't endanger them. These experts may also review analysis from explainers when AIs do cause harm, as when a self-driving car is involved in a fatal accident |

This is one area where AI will contribute to increased employment: Experts estimate that companies will have to create about 75,000 new jobs to administer the GDPR requirements.

### Machines Assisting Humans

Smart machines are helping humans expand their abilities in three ways. They can amplify our cognitive strengths; interact with customers and employees to free us for higher-level tasks; and embody human skills to extend our physical capabilities.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Amplifying | * Artificial intelligence can boost our analytic and decision-making abilities by providing the right information at the right time. But it can also heighten creativity \n * E.g. Autodesk's Dreamcatcher AI enhances the imagination of even exceptional designers \n * A designer provides Dreamcatcher with criteria about the desired product—for example, a chair able to support up to 300 pounds, with a seat 18 inches off the ground, made of materials costing less than $75, and so on \n * Dreamcatcher then churns out thousands of designs that match those criteria, often sparking ideas that the designer might not have initially considered |
| Interacting | * Human-machine collaboration enables companies to interact with employees and customers in novel, more effective ways \n * AI agents like Cortana, for example, can facilitate communications between people or on behalf of people, such as by transcribing a meeting and distributing a voice-searchable version to those who couldn't attend \n * Such applications are inherently scalable—a single chatbot, for instance, can provide routine customer service to large numbers of people simultaneously, wherever they may be |
| Embodying | * Many AIs, like Aida and Cortana, exist principally as digital entities, but in other applications the intelligence is embodied in a robot that augments a human worker. With their sophisticated sensors, motors, and actuators, AI-enabled machines can now recognize people and objects and work safely alongside humans in factories, warehouses, and laboratories \n * In manufacturing, for example, robots are evolving from potentially dangerous and "dumb" industrial machines into smart, context-aware "cobots." A cobot arm might, for example, handle repetitive actions that require heavy lifting, while a person performs complementary tasks that require dexterity and human judgment, such as assembling a gear motor |

### The Need for New Roles and Talent

* Reimagining a business process involves more than the implementation of AI technology; it also requires a significant commitment to developing employees with what we call "fusion skills"—those that enable them to work effectively at the human-machine interface
* To start, people must learn to delegate tasks to the new technology, as when physicians trust computers to help read X-rays and MRIs
* Employees should also know how to combine their distinctive human skills with those of a smart machine to get a better outcome than either could achieve alone, as in robot-assisted surgery. Workers must be able to teach intelligent agents new skills and undergo training to work well within AI-enhanced processes
* For example, they must know how best to put questions to an AI agent to get the information they need
* There must be employees who ensure that their companies' AI systems are used responsibly and not for illegal or unethical purposes
* We expect that in the future, company roles will be redesigned around the desired outcomes of reimagined processes, and corporations will increasingly be organized around different types of skills rather than around rigid job titles
* Some of those skills are what one might expect (for example, proficiency in data science and data wrangling), while others are less obvious (for instance, the ability to use simple machine-learning tools to cross-sell services)

### Human-Machine Collaboration Conclusion

Most activities at the human-machine interface require:
* people to do new and different things (such as train a chatbot)
* and to do things differently (use that chatbot to provide better customer service)

So far, however, only a small number of the companies we've surveyed have begun to reimagine their business processes to optimize collaborative intelligence.

The lesson is clear:
* Organizations that use machines merely to displace workers through automation will miss the full potential of AI. Such a strategy is misguided from the get-go
* Tomorrow's leaders will instead be those that embrace collaborative intelligence, transforming their operations, their markets, their industries, and—no less important—their workforces
