Here’s an overview of external experts, market trends, and strategic foresight impacting the EU and UK banking markets, with a focus on insights from firms like Gartner, McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), and Forrester:

**Strategic Foresight and its Importance:**

*   **Proactive Strategy:** Strategic foresight enables stronger, more resilient strategies by exploring leading indicators of potential change, using big data, specialized advanced analytics, and AI[1]. It helps in identifying opportunities and overcoming challenges[1].
*   **Anticipating Change:** Strategic foresight is essential for anticipating weak signals of potential disruptions and combining rigorous data analysis with imaginative explorations to develop stronger mid- to long-term strategies[1].
*   **Iterative Process:** Strategic foresight should be an iterative process involving deciding where to look, understanding what to look for, separating signals from noise, interpreting signals, and determining actions[1].

**Key Trends and Predictions Impacting the EU and UK Banking Markets:**

*   **Technology Innovation:** Technology innovations are key forces shaping the future. Mechanisms to detect early or weak signals of emerging technologies, especially those with disruptive potential, should be put in place[1].
*   **Changing Customer Needs:** Banks need strategic foresight to understand their customers, their evolving needs, and changing behavior. This provides banks with the necessary analysis and knowledge about future customer needs, enabling them to take the right decisions to be prepared for future change[2].
*   **Strategic Foresight for Innovation:** Strategic foresight is important to understand the organizations’ customers, their evolving needs and changing behavior, and in turn provides banks with the necessary analysis and knowledge about future customer needs, enabling them to take the right decisions to be prepared for future change[8].

**Insights from Consulting Firms and Analysts:**

*   **BCG (Boston Consulting Group):** BCG emphasizes using strategic foresight to identify and challenge biases and assumptions. They highlight the importance of analyzing megatrends and detecting early signals of emerging forces and technologies[1].
*   **PwC:** PwC provides a comprehensive overview of key themes and topics in financial markets regulation through their Strategic Regulatory Foresight Banking Report[7].

**Systemic Trends Impacting Banking:**

*   **Demographic Change, Environmental Change, Urbanization, Globalization, Resource Efficiency, and Digitalization:** Siemens, for example, spotted emerging trends in demographic change, environmental change, urbanization, globalization, resource efficiency, and digitalization before the rest of the market[1].
*   **Weak Strategic Foresight:** According to a survey of 100 Swiss banks (Ernst & Young 2018), banks are short-sighted and detect trends only when real and imminent. Long-term trends are not recognized, neither as threats nor as opportunities. This indicates a weak strategic foresight process of organizations in the financial services industry[2].

To gain a more detailed understanding, consulting reports from firms like Gartner, McKinsey, BCG, and Forrester, should be consulted directly, focusing on their specific banking industry analyses for the EU and UK markets. Additionally, reports and publications focusing on strategic foresight in financial services can provide valuable insights.
