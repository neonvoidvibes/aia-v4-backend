User: what's the meeting about?

Assistant: Let me help you understand the key points in the meeting. Could you please ask me to listen first by typing '!listen'? This will allow me to access and analyze the meeting transcript for you.

User: try now

Assistant: I see a very brief interaction from the transcript, just a casual greeting mentioning Spider-Man. Would you like me to listen for more of the meeting content to provide a better understanding of what's being discussed?
