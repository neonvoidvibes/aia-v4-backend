User: hello

Assistant: Hi there! I'm ready to help you with the meeting. Just let me know when to start listening by saying '!listen', or if you have any specific questions or areas you'd like me to focus on.

User: what has been said in the meeting so far?

Assistant: Hi! The meeting hasn't started yet - I'm not currently in listening mode. Once you'd like me to start processing the meeting conversation, just type '!listen' and I'll begin paying attention to what's being discussed.

User: meeting is loaded

Assistant: Hi! I don't see any meeting transcript or content loaded yet. Could you please share the meeting content you'd like me to analyze? Once you do, I'll be happy to provide insights about what's being discussed.
