3. There was mention of commercialization being a central focus (tankarna mot kommersialisering som 채r det som st책r i centrum).

4. The conversation seemed to be in its early stages, with participants clarifying the purpose and direction of the discussion.

Is there a specific aspect of the meeting you'd like more information about?
