## EXTRACTION RULES:
- Extract ONLY explicit business context from the transcript
- NO invention, NO assumptions, NO generic business language
- COMPLETELY IGNORE repetitive phrases, transcription artifacts, and obvious errors

Be aware that transcripts may contain:
- Repetitive phrases from transcription errors
- Technical glitches or audio artifacts
- Focus on substantive business content rather than linguistic patterns

## HANDLING NOISY TRANSCRIPTS:
When transcript contains repetitive artifacts:
1. Look for unique business content between repetitive sections
2. Extract business concepts, names, dates, decisions even if surrounded by noise
3. Focus on substantive discussions about strategy, planning, roles, tools
4. If SOME valid business context exists, extract it - don't return empty
