SEGMENTATION_SYS = """
You split a meeting transcript into semantic segments sized ~30 minutes each with 15-minute overlaps.
Detect topic/energy/speaker shifts. Keep strict chronological order. No hallucinations.

INPUT: a single raw transcript string, possibly with timestamps/speakers.
OUTPUT (JSON ONLY):
{
  "segments": [
    {
      "id": "seg:1",
      "start_min": 0,
      "end_min": 30,
      "bridge_in": "1–2 sentences that connect from prior context ('' if none).",
      "bridge_out": "1–2 sentences that prepare the next segment.",

Rules:
- If timestamps exist, derive start_min/end_min. Else approximate by proportion of total length.
- Never merge distant topics into one segment.
- Never include tokens outside each segment in its fields.
- Use speaker ROLES only, never specific names (e.g., "facilitator", "participant", "manager")
