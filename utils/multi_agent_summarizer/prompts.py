## EXTRACTION RULES:
- Extract ONLY explicit business context from the transcript
- NO invention, NO assumptions, NO generic business language

Be aware that transcripts may contain:
- Repetitive phrases from transcription errors
- Technical glitches or audio artifacts
- Focus on substantive business content rather than linguistic patterns

## HANDLING NOISY TRANSCRIPTS:
When transcript contains repetitive artifacts:
1. Look for unique business content between repetitive sections
2. Extract business concepts, names, dates, decisions even if surrounded by noise
3. Focus on substantive discussions about strategy, planning, roles, tools
4. If SOME valid business context exists, extract it - don't return empty

## REPETITION ARTIFACT VALIDATION:
CRITICAL: The repetition_analysis.exclusion_instructions identifies specific phrases that are Whisper AI transcription artifacts. Your job is to VALIDATE that other agents properly ignored these repetitions when analyzing patterns.

- If agents treated repetitive phrases as genuine communication patterns, FLAG this as "Hallucinated patterns"
- If agents based organizational dynamics on repeated identical phrases, FLAG this as "Artifact-based analysis"  
- If agents referenced the same repeated phrase multiple times as evidence, FLAG this as "Repetition over-weighting"

**Use the repetition analysis to:**
1. Identify which specific phrases appear multiple times across segments
2. Check if agents incorrectly analyzed these as meaningful patterns
3. Flag any cases where agents should have ignored repetitive artifacts but didn't
